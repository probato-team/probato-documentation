# Overview

## **What is Probato?**

The name **Probato** originates from the Latin word _Probatus_, meaning "related to proof," "demonstrative," "experimental," or "proving necessary qualities for a role." This term reflects the essence of the framework: providing tools to ensure quality in software projects.

In the context of software quality, **Probato** has a central objective:
> To support development teams in ensuring project quality through automated tests, providing efficiency, security, and agility with modern tools and best practices.

**Probato** is an **_Open Source_** framework designed to grow with the community. Developers, testers, and enthusiasts are invited to collaborate with ideas, improvements, and features. This collaborative spirit aims to create a robust and accessible solution that meets real market demands and promotes best practices in test automation.

Your contribution is always welcome: feedback, suggestions, development, or idea sharing are all elements that strengthen this project.

## **Automated Testing**

### **What is Automated Testing?**

Automated testing is the process of using scripts or tools to automatically verify that specific parts of a system function as expected. It reduces manual intervention, increasing efficiency and consistency in software development.

### **Advantages of Automated Testing**

1. **Speed:** Executes tests quickly, even for large test suites.
2. **Reusability:** Scripts can be reused across multiple development cycles.
3. **Consistency:** Reduces human errors by executing steps consistently.
4. **Broader coverage:** Enables testing of complex and broad scenarios.
5. **Continuous validation:** Simplifies regression testing after code changes.
6. **Long-term cost efficiency:** Despite initial costs, reduces expenses over the project lifespan.
7. **Improved quality:** Early defect detection ensures more reliable products.
8. **Rapid feedback:** Provides immediate insights into system stability.
9. **Flexible execution:** Works across various browsers, systems, and devices.
10. **CI/CD integration:** Automates testing within continuous development pipelines.

### **Disadvantages of Automated Testing**

1. **Initial cost:** Configuring and creating tests require significant investment.
2. **Maintenance:** Scripts must be updated as software evolves.
3. **Learning curve:** Requires technical skills for development and maintenance.
4. **Rigidity:** Small changes may necessitate script adjustments.
5. **Dynamic interfaces:** Frequently changing systems pose challenges.
6. **Tool dependency:** Automation may be constrained by available tools.
7. **Inconsistent results:** External issues can cause false positives or negatives.
8. **Limited scope:** Not all tests, such as usability, can be automated.
9. **Delayed ROI:** Short projects may not justify the investment.
10. **Complex scenarios:** Some contexts require custom solutions.
